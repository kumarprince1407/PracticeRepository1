Confirm

Syntax: result = confirm(question);

The function 'confirm' shows a modal window sith a question and two buttons: OK and Cancel.
The result is true of OK is pressed and false otherwise.

For example:
let isBoss = confirm("Are you the boss?");
alert (isBoss); //true if OK is pressed

Logical operators
The precedence of AND(&&) operators is higher than OR(||).

The precedence of NOT ! is the highest of all logical operators,
so it always executes first, before && or ||.

//October 18

The important difference between || and && is that:

|| returns the first truthy value.
?? returns the first defined value.

For example: 
let height = 0;

alert(height || 100); // 100
alert(height ?? 100); // 0


Default values

If a function is called, but an argument is not provided, then the corresponding value becomes undefined.
